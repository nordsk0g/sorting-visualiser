Here is a sorting visualiser that was based off of Clement Mihailescu's sorting visualiser tutorial. At the time of writing this, I've only added bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort but there are plans to add other sorting algorithms. I had a lot of fun building this and gained a deeper understanding of some of the main sorting algorithms as a result of this.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
